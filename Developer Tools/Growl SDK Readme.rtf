\f0\fs24 \cf0 Hello Developer,\
\

\b Regarding the 3.0 SDK
\b0 \
\
\pard\pardeftab720

\fs26 \cf0 Hello all! I am here today to talk about Growl.framework 3.0!\
\
We have been hard at work the last couple weeks doing a total remodel of how Growl.framework works inside, and will expand going forward. But wait! I know I know 3.0 sounds scary, its a big number update, and we changed a *lot* of things behind the scenes, but Growl 3.0 continues to support the same platforms and configurations Growl.framework 2.0 and 1.4 and 1.3 did. It talks to the same versions of Growl, and most importantly, it is API backwards compatible with all those versions, in addition to 1.2.x as well. For some new features, you will need to update your usage, but we have tried to make this as easy as possible for you, and flexible going forward for other features.\
\
So, first, lets talk about what we changed, and then we can talk a bit about what's been added. GrowlApplicationBridge is now a true singleton instead of a bunch of scary statics and responds to +sharedBridge to get to it. GrowlApplicationBridge has a number of new KVO friendly properties for things like isGrowlRunning. All the older class methods remain and talk to the sharedBridge, and a number have had instance method clones added.\
\
So far so good? Now for the added. GrowlNote is a new class, where all individual note API will be added. It generates a UUID that you can hang on to and use for canceling notes, and if they are still up, we will pull them down from any display they might have used, whether its notification center, mist or smoke. Notification Center action/cancel button titles are here as well. We now support per notification delegation or block based callbacks on the final status of a note, and we support a lot more statuses:\
Canceled (sent when you cancel a note)\
Not displayed (sent when due to user settings either in UI or the rules system cause a note to be not displayed)\
Closed\
Timed Out\
Clicked\
Action Clicked\
Other Clicked\
Note as usual that not all end conditions can be reached in all configurations. Only NotificationCenter at this time supports Action/Other Clicked, and Growl older than 2.1 won't support anything other than Click/Timed Out.\
\
This new class opens us up to adding more API much easier then before, and nicely separates responsibility. GrowlApplicationBridge has a new method: -(void)notifyWithNote:(GrowlNote*)note to go along with this, which will take ownership of the note until we have a final status on it.\
\
For those of you using the XPC, you will need to update it as well, as many new features require support in it as well.\
\
If you would like to help us in testing out this new framework, and provide further feedback, feel free to contact us and we will get you added to the beta list!. We look forward to working with you!

Growl and Notification Center on 10.8

The release of 10.8 means that you will now need to include Notification Center in your notification solution. Here is a short summary of how this change will work.\

\cf0 \
\
\
Here is a more detailed explanation:\
\
\pard\tx220\tx720\pardeftab720\li720\fi-720
\ls4\ilvl0\cf0 {\listtext	1)	}The framework basically has a 'send to notification center' flag. If Growl is not running, this flag is true. Alternatively, if Growl *is* running, the framework will be told whether or not the big 'Use OS X Notifications' switch is flipped, and the flag set from that.\
{\listtext	2)	}If this flag is set to true, when the app generates a Growl notification, the notification will also be packaged up and sent to Notification Center. Since the app is sending the notification itself, it appears with the appropriate app icon and title. If Growl is running, the notification is also sent to Growl with a special GNTP header field set, to mark that it's already been shown. Growl will then handle any automation/actions necessary, but won't do the visual displays.\
{\listtext	3)	}If the flag is set to false, notifications go to Growl as normal, without the 'do not display this visually' GNTP header.\
{\listtext	4)	}If Growl receives a notification without the 'do not display this visually' bit set \'97 such as from a legacy version of the framework \'97 while the 'Use OS X Notifications' switch is flipped to true, then it will pass the notification on to Notification Center itself. The downside here is that the notification will be sent by Growl rather than the host app, and thus will have the Growl icon and title, though the subtitle portion is used to label which app made it. On the upside, it means legacy Growl notifications can appear in Notification Center.\
\pard\pardeftab720
\cf0 \
In either case, Growl notifications passed to Notification Center are left up for two minutes and then expired; this emulates Growl notifications fading away and avoids cluttering Notification Center with 8 billion little status notifications. If the 'sticky' bit is set, of course, the notification is not expired.\
\
In essence, you just write notifications like normal, and then things Just Work. If the user has Growl installed, it uses their visual display or uses Notification Center, as per the user's preferences. If the user does not have Growl installed and is on Mountain Lion, it uses Notification Center. If the user does not have Growl installed and is on Lion or Snow Leopard, it uses the framework's built-in 'Mist' system.\
\pard\tx720\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\pardirnatural
\cf0 \
Finally, another way to explain the scenario.\
\
\
The Growl 2 framework introduces support for Notification Center. It will work like this:\
\
\pard\tx220\tx720\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\li720\fi-720\pardirnatural
\ls5\ilvl0\cf0 {\listtext	\uc0\u8259 	}If on 10.6 or 10.7 and Growl is not present, then use Mist (the built-in notification in the framework).\
{\listtext	\uc0\u8259 	}Else, if on 10.8 and Growl is not present, then use Notification Center.\
{\listtext	\uc0\u8259 	}If Growl is running, use Growl.\
{\listtext	\uc0\u8259 	}If the Notification Center switch in Growl is on\
\pard\tx940\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\li1440\fi-1440\pardirnatural
\ls5\ilvl1\cf0 {\listtext	\uc0\u8259 	}Use Notification Center to display notifications direct from applications. \
{\listtext	\uc0\u8259 	}Use Growl to execute actions\
\pard\tx720\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\pardirnatural
\cf0 \
You can also always send to Notification Center. Look in the Headers inside of the framework for documentation on this, specifically in GrowlDefines.h.\
\

\b Growl and Sandboxing
\b0 \
\
We document a lot of the Sandboxing bits on our Cocoa Developer Guide. However, keep in mind that if you use the XPC Client, that you also need to update that when you update the framework.\
\

\b Building
\b0 \
\
Ensure that you are building in 64 bit.\
